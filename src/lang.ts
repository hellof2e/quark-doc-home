    weBelieve: "我们认为",
    weBelieveDesc1: "组件库可以不用依赖技术框架而存在。",
    weBelieveDesc2: "如果能做到这点，那么这个组件库可以穿越沉浮，历经长久!",
    weBelieveDesc3: "不用随着技术栈的更新而更新。",
    whatWeDo: "我们做了什么",
    whatWeDoDesc1:
      "得益于 Web Components 在浏览器的原生支持特性，我们使用该技术开发了 Quark Design。",
    whatWeDoDesc2: "这让前端组件库真正实现了「技术栈无关」，无框架，跨框架。",
    advantage: "有什么优势",
    box1Title: "体积小",
    box1Desc:
      "无框架原生构建，平均每个组件体积 1kb ~ 2kb 左右（甚至部分组件体积小于1kb）。",
    box2Title: "W3C标准",
    box2Desc: "组件由浏览器原生api实现，Quarkd 底层基于Web Components，面向未来。",
    box3Title: "跨技术栈",
    box3Desc:
      "不依赖任何前端框架！一套组件，所有技术框架皆可使用。",
    whatDesc1:
      "Quarkd（Quark design缩写）是一种全新的组件库，底层基于Web Components，不同于传统组件框架（如Antd, Vant），需要浏览器中需要做大量前置工作。Quarkd则将这些工作放到构建应用程序的编译时来处理。",
    whatDesc2: "组件的数据更新响应由浏览器自身API处理，更简单，更高效！",

    whatWeDoDesc1:
      "Benefiting from the native support of web components in browsers, we developed Quark Design using this technology.Frameless, Cross-Frame.",

      "Framework-free native build, the average volume of each component is about 1kb ~ 2kb (even some components are smaller than 1kb).",
    box2Title: "W3C standards",
    box2Desc:
      "Components are implemented by the browser's native API, and the underlying layer of Quarkd is based on Web Components and is future-oriented.",

    box3Desc:
      "Does not rely on any front-end framework! A set of components that can be used by all technology frameworks.",
    whatDesc1:
      "Quarkd (Quark design abbreviation) is a brand-new component library. The bottom layer is based on Web Components. Unlike traditional component frameworks (such as Antd and Vant), it requires a lot of pre-work in the browser. Quarkd handles these tasks at compile time when building applications.",
    whatDesc2:
      "The data modification of the component is handled by the browser's own API, which is simpler and more efficient!",
